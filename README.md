💻 Developer | 🚀 Intern @ Fansocial | 🌐 JavaScript & Node.js Enthusiast

Hey there! I'm Aanchal, a passionate developer working on real-world UI and backend challenges using JavaScript, Node.js, PHP, and more. I thrive on turning design ideas into functional, responsive interfaces and crafting efficient APIs that make the magic happen behind the scenes.

I’m currently an intern at Fansocial, where I get to build and debug live features, learn new technologies daily, and grow by solving real user problems. Whether it’s wrangling a carousel, fixing media fallbacks, or organizing clean and scalable code, I’m always ready to dive in.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
- JavaScript (ES6+), Node.js, PHP
- HTML5, CSS3, Tachyon CSS
- MySQL, REST APIs
- Debugging... lots of debugging 🐛

📚 Lifelong learner. Code explorer. Open to collaboration and cool projects!

Let’s connect and build awesome things together 🚀
